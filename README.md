[`tink`](https://github.com/npm/tink) is an experimental package manager for
JavaScript. Don't expect to be able to use this with any of your existing
projects.

## **IN DEVELOPMENT**

This package is still in development. Do **not** use it for production. It is
missing major features and the interface should be considered extremely
unstable.

If you're feeling adventurous, though, read ahead...

## Usage

`$ npx tink`

but now it's a package manager runtime!
